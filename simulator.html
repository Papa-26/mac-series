            The MAC-SERIES of four educational computer simulations was developed jointly between 1970 and 1985 in close cooperation by colleagues from the Faculty of Health Sciences (McMaster University) in Canada and the Medical College of St. Bartholomew's Hospital (University of London) in the UK. This allowed medical students to experiment with the vital functions of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal systems and how drugs are handled in the body without exposing live humans or animals to risks or discomfort. The four computer programs were MacDope, MacMan, MacPee, and MacPuf.

                        We might still find a PDP 11 or an IBM PC in some museums. However, we would need help finding a matching FORTRAN compiler. But fear not! Jeff Parsons from Seattle, WA, has relieved us of that burden. He has developed a method of running ancient machine code in our web browser. Clicking the <u>"Simulate"</u> button below, results in a new web page with the picture of an IBM PC screen.

                        First, we must optimize the processing frequency by repeatedly clicking the corresponding button to achieve the computer's highest possible processing frequency. Be patient, the button is cycling through all availble processing frequencies.

                        Before starting the simulator, we might want to download the manual of the specific computer model to have it handy. Now click the "Full Screen" button, and you are ready to simulate. On your keyboard, type DOPE, MAN, PEE, or PUF, and then follow the on-screen instructions.
