            The MAC-SERIES of four educational computer simulations was developed jointly between 1970 and 1985 in close cooperation by colleagues from the Faculty of Health Sciences (McMaster University) in Canada and the Medical College of St. Bartholomew's Hospital (University of London) in the UK. This allowed medical students to experiment with the vital functions of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal systems and how drugs are handled in the body without exposing live humans or animals to risks or discomfort. The four computer programs were MacDope, MacMan, MacPee, and MacPuf.
