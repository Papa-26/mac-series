            The MAC-SERIES of four educational computer simulations was developed jointly between 1970 and 1985 in close cooperation by colleagues from the Faculty of Health Sciences (McMaster University) in Canada and the Medical College of St. Bartholomew's Hospital (University of London) in the UK. This allowed medical students to experiment with the vital functions of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal systems and how drugs are handled in the body without exposing live humans or animals to risks or discomfort. The four computer programs were MacDope, MacMan, MacPee, and MacPuf.

                        <p>One of John Dickinson's colleagues and closest friends was Arthur C. Guyton (1919 - 2003) the renowned U.S. physiologist, educator, and author.</p>
                        <p>His Textbook of Medical Physiology, appeared in 14 editions, and 15 languages. It provided thousands of physicians worldwide with a deeper understanding of human physiology. His major research interest was devoted to biological cybernetics.</p>
                        <p>In the 1972 Annual Reviews of Physiology he presented his monumental model of cardio-vascular control. It seems quite plausible that this model not only became a frequent topic between the two friends, but that it might well have triggered John Dickinson's idea for the series of physiological computer models.</p>
