            The MAC-SERIES of four educational computer simulations was developed jointly between 1970 and 1985 in close cooperation by colleagues from the Faculty of Health Sciences (McMaster University) in Canada and the Medical College of St. Bartholomew's Hospital (University of London) in the UK. This allowed medical students to experiment with the vital functions of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal systems and how drugs are handled in the body without exposing live humans or animals to risks or discomfort. The four computer programs were MacDope, MacMan, MacPee, and MacPuf.        </div>

                    John Dickinson produced four instructional videos using computer simulations to demonstrate some fundamental physiological principles inherent to human cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal physiology and the way the body handles foreign substances. These four video lectures are accessible from this page. The demonstrations also vividly illustrate the immense progress video and computer technologies have made over the past fifty years.

                    Apart from showing John Dickinson as a superb teacher, the videos also demonstrate the potential of computer simulations for investigating and explaining complex processes despite the somewhat primitive technological level of the 1970s.

                    To view any of the videos, just click on the corresponding field. You may be somewhat disappointed with the technical quality, but please keep in mind not only the state of video technology in the 1970s but also the fact that the UMATIC tapes on which they were recorded have suffered for over 40 years in some forgotten basement archive to be revived in a 2024 lab.
