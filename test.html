            The MAC-SERIES of four educational computer simulations was developed jointly between 1970 and 1985 in close cooperation by colleagues from the Faculty of Health Sciences (McMaster University) in Canada and the Medical College of St. Bartholomew's Hospital (University of London) in the UK. This allowed medical students to experiment with the vital functions of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal systems and how drugs are handled in the body without exposing live humans or animals to risks or discomfort. The four computer programs were MacDope, MacMan, MacPee, and MacPuf.

                    The McMaster Faculty of Medicine was founded in 1966. One of its primary objectives was to help students become effective solvers of biomedical problems by understanding the principles essential to solving them and learning how to seek out and use the information required for solutions. The nascent faculty was exploring new and hopefully effective ways of achieving its objectives. It aimed to replace the usual formal lectures with stimulated, problem-based, self-directed learning. Although many audio-visual aids were developed, whether for ethical, economical, or practical reasons, students were rarely exposed to labs and experimentation, a traditional stimulus to inquiry. Problems presented on printed paper alone often fail to trigger curiosity and active search for information.
